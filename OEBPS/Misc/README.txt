    Unix One: An Introduction to the Unix Command Interface
========================================================================
This course will take someone with no knowledge of the Unix command 
line to being able to find out basic information about the environment, 
navigate around directories doing simple file manipulation, and 
communicate with other users: all in the command line!

During these exercises the user is encouraged to get help from the system
itself and thereby the foundation is laid for more advanced uses of the
Unix system.

Also the most important text editors and text manupulation will be 
introduced.
